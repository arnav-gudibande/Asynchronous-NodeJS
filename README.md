# Weather-js

Node.js weather app

This app fetches the weather of your current location.

It uses the ipinfo.io and the OpenWeatherMap API to determine your location and get current weather.

### Usage

Navigate into the folder where you have downloaded this file.

Then start the program:

```javascript
  npm start
```

If the app is not able to detect your location, you will have to enter it manually:

```javascript
  node app.js -l "Your location (eg. Boston)"
```
